# Lesson Learnt through Project Eulers Problems 

1. Instead of calculating for multiples and then subtracting them I could have easily used a logical OR operator.
2. Instead of doing things in a complex manner I should find a better and easier way to do something.
3. THE NUMBER DIVISION WAS AN LCM METHOD !!! It took me 4 days after solving to figure it out. 
4. Any methods or objects or variables that are to be used in main method and functional methods we need to declare them at a class level outside the methods in order for it to be acessible. 
5. Adding a counter would help me check the progress of certain operations or even methods. 
6. This was a joke. 
7. Instead of adding values into an array I could initialize a hashmap which would have much more unique value and can help in getting rid of redundant and repeating values. I learnt that I could compare the values already present in hash map to the new values being added. This would help me in avoiding many new repeating elements. POSITIONING THE INCREMENT OF COUNTER IS CRITICAL.
