/**
 * Largestpalindrome
 */

/* A palindromeic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindromee made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindromee made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
*/

/* 
 * First I initialized two loops that would produce products and even palindromes. But I knew that largest palindrome had to be a 6 digit number
 * 
 * Also I converted a number into an string for the purpose of checking the palindrome logic and then I converted those string back to integer in order to put them into an array then sort them out for easier identification.
 *  
 * Hence I added another checkpoint where palindromes and products shouldn't be less than 6 digits. 
 * 
 * Then I created another function which would take all the products and basically search for palindromes within all those products.
 * 
 * Count is basically useless so you don't need to use it.
 * 
 * the main issue was I was able to assign all the palindromes into an array list but unable to sort them out. When iterating through integers I was getting the palindromes. But when printing the palindrome itself I was getting infinite empty array. With a little help the sorting happened. 
 * 
 * Basically I thought that the issue was with the sorting when in fact it was about initialising the array. 
 * Instead of initialising the array inside the main method I needed to declare it outside hence I could access it and then add values into it.
